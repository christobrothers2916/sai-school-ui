          <p>
            SA International began its journey in 2018 as "Kids Valley," a small
            yet ambitious learning space with a few students. Over the years,
            the school grew steadily, attracting more students and gaining a
            reputation for quality education and child-centered learning. By
            2023, SA International was officially established.

          <p>
            SAIS focuses on "learning by doing" rather than rote learning.
            Personalized attention is ensured with a teacher-student ratio of
            1:15 for Pre-Nursery and Nursery, and 1:25 for higher classes. Our

          <p>Dear Parents, Students, and Community Members,</p>
          <p>
            It is my great pleasure to welcome you to SA International, a school
            built on the foundation of nurturing the uniqueness of every child.
            Since our humble beginnings in 2018 as Kids Valley, we have grown
            into a thriving learning community known as SA International.
          </p>
          <p>
            At SA International, we believe that education goes beyond
            textbooks—it is about curiosity, exploration, and lifelong learning.
            Our vision is to create an environment where every child is valued,
            every teacher is inspired, and every learning experience is
            meaningful.
          </p>
          <p>
            We strongly believe that education is a partnership between
            students, teachers, and parents. We encourage open communication and
            collaboration to ensure the success of every child.
          </p>
          <p>
            As we move forward, we remain committed to our mission of empowering
            young minds, fostering innovation, and preparing our students for a
            bright future.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Warm Regards,</strong></p>
