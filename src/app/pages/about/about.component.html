                SA International began its journey in 2018 as "Kids Valley," a
                small yet ambitious learning space with a few students. Over the
                years, the school grew steadily, attracting more students and
                gaining a reputation for quality education and child-centered
                learning. By 2023, SA International was officially established.

              <p>Dear Parents, Students, and Community Members,</p>
              <p>
                It is my great pleasure to welcome you to SA International, a
                school built on the foundation of nurturing the uniqueness of
                every child. Since our humble beginnings in 2018 as Kids Valley,
                we have grown into a thriving learning community known as SA
                International.
              </p>
              <p>
                At SA International, we believe that education goes beyond
                textbooks—it is about curiosity, exploration, and lifelong
                learning. Our vision is to create an environment where every
                child is valued, every teacher is inspired, and every learning
                experience is meaningful.
              </p>
              <p>
                We strongly believe that education is a partnership between
                students, teachers, and parents. We encourage open communication
                and collaboration to ensure the success of every child.
              </p>
              <p>
                As we move forward, we remain committed to our mission of
                empowering young minds, fostering innovation, and preparing our
                students for a bright future.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Warm Regards,</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Shiji,</strong></p>
